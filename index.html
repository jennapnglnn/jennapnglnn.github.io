    <h3>Rosa Marie Nicole Brutas</h3>
    <h5 class="title-person">Art Student in CIIT</h5>
    <p>"As a regular user of social media and other online platforms, I really admire the 
      layout created by JEPP for GoComix. The website they created was highly efficient 
      with their accessibility, but still aesthetically pleasing and well organized.

      Additionally, their attention to detail in design elements, such as the use of vibrant 
      colors and visually appealing graphics, creates an engaging and immersive experience 
      for users in both of their website design and previous projects. It's evident that 
      JEPP prioritizes both form and function, ensuring that every aspect of the website 
      contributes to a seamless and enjoyable streaming experience. 
      
      I hope other websites will take note of GoComix and follow JEPP's example of 
      prioritizing design and accessibility to enhance the user experience for all."

    <h3>Sean Warner Dean Datu</h3>
    <h5 class="title-person">Staff of Multimedia and Creatives in Code Geeks</h5>
    <p>"I had fun collaborating with Jenna on a web design project, and I must say her 
      work is truly marvelous and spectacular. Jenna has creativity, technical skills, 
      and attention to detail. Her insight into web design is innovative. She doesn't 
      just design good-looking websites, she makes sure they're easy for people to use 
      and simplistic. There is one project that Jenna made is the Algebra Infographic 
      for me it is visually appealing and elegant. The color theme and the arcade style 
      of the work are immaculate. The icons/pictures she used are eye-catching and 
      on-point on each topic. I recommend Jenna for any website job or UI/UX Design. 
      Her skills and her professionalism are really good."</p>

      <h3>Chariz Lorenz Cadiang</h3>
      <h5 class="title-person">Former Colleague in Publication</h5>
      <p>"As someone who frequents websites for watching and streaming, I appreciate the 
        layout they made for GoComix. It is challenging to find websites who utilize design 
        and accessibility especially with streaming sites, they often sacrifice one or the 
        other but with JEPP's case, they made it work: appealing and easy. Looking forward 
        for more collaborations from them and hopefully other websites will take their work 
        as an example!"</p>

    <h3>Jamaica Guina</h3>
    <h5 class="title-person">Staff of Multimedia and Creatives in Code Geeks</h5>
    <p>"Jenna showed remarkable professionalism, as she was able to do all the webpages 
      on time. Given the situation that I only had a couple of weeks before needing the 
      project, she managed to do it even under pressure. I will again be availing her 
      services again in the near future for being able to deliver my demands so well."</p>

        effort into it, and it shows. Everything is clear and easy to understand. I'm super 
        impressed with what she's done. Great job, Jenna!"</p>

      <h3>Abby Dizon</h3>
      <h5 class="title-person">Head of Academic and Research in Code Geeks</h5>
      <p>"Her works are simply inspiring and pleasing to the eye. I could tell that she 
        is very clever in  organizing her ideas and putting them together all in one frame. 
        Design wise, the aesthetics are balanced. Adding a litte spark to the minimal canvas 
        goes a long way with her works. A truly beautiful way in maintaining harmony in her 
        design and development in general.❤️"</p>

        professionalism, attention to detail, and dedication to customer satisfaction 
        were exceptional. I highly recommend her for quality service. Thank you, Jenna,

    <h3>J Victorino Zulueta</h3>
    <h5 class="title-person">Former Colleague in Front-End Development</h5>
    <p>"This website is incredibly well-crafted! The UI design is visually captivating, 
      with a clean and intuitive interface that makes navigation a breeze. It's clear 
      that a lot of thought has gone into the user experience (UX), and it truly inspires 
      me as a UI/UX designer. It motivates me to create websites that are not only 
      aesthetically pleasing but also prioritize user-friendliness and a seamless 
      navigation flow."</p>

    <h3>Kisses Shannen Reyes</h3>

      colleague who worked with her for two years, she is really dedicated and 
      exert efforts in making the output becomes pleasing and attractive to the 
      audience. I commend her passion in designing and developing as she paid 
      attention to the details. Overall, I am grateful that I worked with her 
      and looking forward to her more creative outputs"</p>
